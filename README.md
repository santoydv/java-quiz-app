# Java Quiz Application

A simple console-based quiz application built using Java to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Project Structure

- `Question.java`  
  Model class representing a quiz question with options and correct answer.

- `QuestionService.java`  
  Contains quiz logic: displays questions, collects user input, and calculates score.

- `Main.java`  
  Entry point of the application.

## Features

- Multiple-choice questions
- User input via console
- Score calculation
- Clean separation of concerns using OOP

## OOP Concepts Used

- Encapsulation (private fields with public getters)
- Abstraction (quiz logic hidden inside service class)
- Single Responsibility Principle

## How to Run

1. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
